## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the complete solution developed by **Team BoilerSignal (Purdue University)** for the **ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge: Estimation of Site-Specific Radio Propagation Loss Estimation with Minimal Information**.

The challenge, organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under the AI for Good initiative, focused on developing machine learning models for estimating **urban radio propagation loss (PL)** using limited geometric and environmental information.

## 2. Problem Formulation

Urban radio propagation loss depends on multiple factors:

- Line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions  
- Building obstruction and diffraction  
- Frequency-dependent behavior  
- Transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) geometry  
- Multipath propagation  

Participants were provided with:

- A detailed 3D mesh (OBJ format) of a region in Tokyo  
- Tx–Rx coordinate pairs  
- Ground-truth propagation loss values for three frequency bands:
  - 800 MHz  
  - 7 GHz  
  - 28 GHz  

The objective was to predict propagation loss for unseen Tx–Rx pairs without performing computationally expensive ray-tracing simulations.

## 3. Methodology Overview

Our solution is based on **geometry-aware feature extraction combined with machine learning regression models**.

### 3.1 Geometric Region Extraction

For each Tx–Rx pair, we extracted localized geometric regions from the 3D city mesh:

1. TX-centered sphere (50 m radius)
2. RX-centered sphere (50 m radius)
3. 1st Fresnel ellipsoid
4. 3rd Fresnel ellipsoid

These regions capture:

- Local obstruction density  
- Fresnel zone blockage  
- Diffraction-relevant structures  
- Near-field scattering environment  

Mesh clipping operations were performed to isolate only the surfaces intersecting these regions.

---

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

From the clipped regions, we computed structured geometric descriptors including:

- Number of intersecting faces  
- Obstruction counts between Tx and Rx  
- LOS/NLOS indicator  
- Tx–Rx distance  
- Frequency-derived wavelength  
- Fresnel obstruction metrics  
- Height-related features  

These features form a compact geometric representation of the propagation environment.

### 3.3 Learning Approaches

We explored two modeling paradigms:

#### A. PointNet-Based Deep Learning

- Converted clipped mesh surfaces to point clouds  
- Trained PointNet to learn geometric embeddings  
- Used embeddings as additional propagation features  

#### B. Gradient Boosting (Final Model)

- Trained CatBoost regressors using engineered geometric features  
- Achieved superior stability and performance  
- Selected as the final submission model  

The final solution uses **CatBoost regression over geometry-derived features**.

#### `b_training_propagation_loss/`
Training datasets for:
- 800 MHz  
- 7 GHz  
- 28 GHz  

Each file contains Tx–Rx coordinates and true propagation loss values.

#### `c_evaluation_propagation_loss/`
Evaluation dataset used for final submission generation.

#### `catboost_training/`
Processed feature datasets used for CatBoost training.
